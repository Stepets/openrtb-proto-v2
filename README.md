# OpenRTB Libraries

This library was originally created by Google. It supports the OpenRTB
2.x specification, providing bindings for all protobuf-supported
languages, and additional support for Java such as JSON serialization
and validation.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/google/openrtb/wiki) to get started!
Use the Github issue tracker for bugs, RFEs or any support. Check the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.


## Building notes

You need: JDK 8, Maven 3.2, Protocol buffers (protoc) 3.5.1.
Building is supported from the command line with Maven and
from any IDE that can load Maven projects.

On Eclipse, the latest m2e is recommended but it can't run the code
generation step, so you need to run a "mvn install" from the command
line after checkout or after any mvn clean.


## Release notes

### IAB-3.0.0
- Update to the proto-to-JSON conversion for a few fields that are integer in the OpenRTB spec that *were* being sent as booleans in JSON, and *now* are sent as integers.

### IAB-2.0.0
- Update the index for `$.user.consent` and `$.content.data` to match Google's choices, as we iterate towards a single specification. Note this is a breaking change from previous versions.
